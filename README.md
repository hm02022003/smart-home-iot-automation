# Smart Home IoT Automation – Bachelor Thesis Project

This repository contains the code, data, analysis, and results of my Bachelor's thesis titled **"Business IoT Issues for the Automation of Residential Buildings"**, completed by **Mahdi Houshangi**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main goal of this thesis was to explore how Business IoT and machine learning techniques can be applied to automate smart homes in a more **adaptive**, **energy-efficient**, and **user-centric** way.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Most current smart home systems suffer from:
- High and unnecessary energy consumption
- Lack of adaptive and personalized automation
- Poor interoperability among devices from different manufacturers

This project investigates how to overcome these limitations using real-world data and AI-driven decision models.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Visualization Tools:** Grafana, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, Neural Networks
- **Dataset:** 10,000-sample Smart Home IoT dataset (from Kaggle)

## 📊 Contents of This Repository

- `Thesis-Mahdi Houshangi.pdf`: Full thesis document
- `10000 Mahdi_Houshangi_sampled_smart_home_dataset.csv`: Cleaned and sampled dataset
- `Codes.docx`: Code documentation and explanation
- `*.png / *.jpg`: Visual analysis results (correlation heatmaps, energy trends, etc.)
- `Table 5.csv`: Sample analysis output

## 🔍 Key Results

- Up to **15% reduction in energy consumption** using data-driven automation
- Adaptive rule-based automation designed based on **real user behavior**
- Proposed architectural improvements for **device interoperability**

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

Here are a few examples of the analytical insights produced:

- Correlation heatmaps between appliances and energy usage
- Hourly and seasonal consumption trends
- Behavior-based energy usage predictions
